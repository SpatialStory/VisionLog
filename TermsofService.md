# Terms of Service

Last Updated: March 1, 2024

## Introduction

Welcome to VisionLog. These Terms of Service, together with our Privacy Policy, ("Terms") govern our relationship with you as a user of VisionLog ("Services", "Licensed Application"). Our aim is to make our Services as user-friendly as possible, providing you with clear information on how they operate through these Terms and direct communications within the Services themselves, such as notifications, consents, and customizable settings. Collectively, this information forms the foundation of our agreement with you.

While we've made an effort to ensure these Terms are straightforward, some sections may still resemble a traditional contract. This is necessary because our relationship with you needs to be supported by a legally binding agreement between you and VisionLog ("we", "us"). We encourage you to read these Terms and the included Privacy Policy carefully.

By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree to these Terms, under which we grant you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to use the Services according to these Terms and our policies. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the Services.

**ARBITRATION NOTICE:** These Terms include an arbitration clause. You and VisionLog agree that disputes between us will be resolved through mandatory binding arbitration, and both you and VisionLog waive any right to participate in a class-action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.

## Acknowledgment

You and VisionLog acknowledge that these Terms are between you and VisionLog only, and not with Apple Inc. ("Apple"). VisionLog, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Licensed Application and its content. These Terms do not provide for usage rules for the Licensed Application in conflict with the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions as of the Last Updated date.

## Who Can Use the Services

Our Services are intended for individuals who are 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13, or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction to use our Services without parental consent (whichever is greater, ("Minimum Age")), please do not engage with our Services.

By creating an account with VisionLog, you acknowledge and agree that you have read, understood, and accept to be bound by these Terms. This acceptance is considered as your agreement to all the terms, conditions, policies, and notices stated here.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the Minimum Age. It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet the age requirements outlined in these Terms. Should we discover, or receive credible information, that you are under the Minimum Age, we will stop providing Services to you and delete your account and your data. This measure is in place to comply with legal standards and protect the privacy and safety of all our users.

If you are a minor in your jurisdiction, typically under the age of 18, we strongly encourage the involvement of a parent or guardian. Not only should a parent or guardian review these Terms with you to ensure understanding and agreement, but we also suggest they monitor your internet usage. This supervision helps ensure that your engagement with online content, including our Services, is appropriate and safe.

In addition to meeting the Minimum Age requirement and having the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract, by accessing our Services, you affirm that:

- You are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo or has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country;
- You are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but not limited to the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals;
- You have not been prohibited from using the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, including being a convicted sex offender;
- You agree to adhere to these Terms, along with all related policies referenced herein, in addition to complying with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations.

## Rights You Grant Us

Our Services provide you with the opportunity to upload content, including spatial videos ("Content"), which will be publicly accessible to all users. In doing so, you retain any ownership rights you may have in your Content. However, you grant VisionLog a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, host, store, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, transmit, and distribute your Content. This license is necessary for us to operate, promote, and improve our Services, as well as to explore and develop new offerings.

This license you grant to VisionLog for the Licensed Application is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Licensed Application on any supported Apple-branded products that you own or control as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.

Given the public nature of the Content on our platform, it's important to understand that all Content you upload are automatically considered public and can be viewed by any user of the Services. By sharing Content, you grant VisionLog, our affiliates, and our users an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and perpetual license to access, use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works from, and display your Content across any media for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. This extensive license includes not only the content itself but also the use of any personal attributes like your username as part of that content.

Although not obligated, we reserve the right to access, review, screen, and delete any Content you provide at our discretion, especially if it's believed to violate these Terms or applicable laws. Ultimately, you are responsible for the Content you share through our Services. Remember, all Content must be suitable for individuals aged 13 and above.

We welcome your suggestions and feedback regarding our Services. Please be aware that by providing feedback, you agree that VisionLog has the right to use and act upon such feedback without any obligations to provide acknowledgment or compensation to you, and that we will retain ownership of any developments that arise from your suggestions.

## Privacy Policy

Your privacy matters to us, and we want you to know what information we are collecting from you and how we are using it.

### Information We Collect

Our Services are not intended for children under 13, or the minimum age required for consent in your jurisdiction if higher. We delete accounts and data of users below this age. In some cases, we may limit service functionalities for users under 18.

## Content Moderation

Content on VisionLog is created and shared by our users. The responsibility for the Content lies with the user or entity that submitted it. While we are committed to creating a safe and respectful platform, it's important to note that we cannot review all content shared on our Services. As such, we cannot, and do not, guarantee that other users and Content on the Services will always adhere to our Terms or any other provided guidelines and policies.

Your reports are invaluable in helping us maintain a safe and welcoming platform for all users. If you come across content that appears to violate our Terms, you can take action by flagging the objectionable content or blocking the abusive user.

Upon receiving a report, we will:
- Conduct a thorough and impartial review of the reported content or abusive user within 24 hours;
- Reverse any prior decisions if an initial assessment was incorrect;
- Remove the content and eject the user who provided the offending content is our assessment determines the content or user has violated the Terms.

We appreciate your cooperation and vigilance in reporting content that may not meet our standards. Together, we can continue to build a platform that respects and protects the community.

## Respecting the Services and VisionLog's Rights

The Services, including all associated intellectual property such as branding, software, technology, along with any content we make available, are the sole property of VisionLog. Your experience with the Services is guided by these Terms and our commitment to fostering a creative and respectful community.

To promote a positive environment for all users and safeguard our intellectual property, we ask you to adhere to the following guidelines. Failure to comply may result in the termination or suspension of your access to the Services:

- You may not use our branding, logos, designs, or any other proprietary materials provided through the Services, except as expressly permitted by these Terms or through explicit consent provided by VisionLog. This includes respecting our copyright and trademark rights, as well as the copyright and trademark rights of third parties.
- You must not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or otherwise exploit the Services and the content therein, except as allowed by these Terms or through features explicitly provided by the Services.
- Do not attempt to create a new account if we have disabled your account, access the Services through unauthorized methods, solicit login credentials from others, or buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your account or username.
- Do not reverse-engineer our Services, use automated means to interact with the Services without permission, or introduce malicious code. Your actions should not compromise the Services' operational integrity or other users' experiences.
- Ensure your use of the Services abides by applicable laws and regulations and does not jeopardize the Services' security or functionality.
- Engage with the Services and other users in a manner that is respectful, lawful, and in accordance with these Terms and any additional guidelines we may provide.

Our goal is to keep VisionLog a vibrant space for users to engage with and enjoy spatial video content. Your respect for these guidelines plays a crucial role in realizing this vision, and we appreciate your cooperation in fostering a supportive and respectful community.

## Respecting Others' Rights

At VisionLog, we hold the rights of others in high regard, and we expect our users to do the same. This commitment extends to ensuring that the Services are not used to violate or infringe upon anyone's rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or any other intellectual property rights. When you share Content on our platform, you affirm that you either own this Content or have obtained all necessary permissions, licenses, and authorizations to use it — including, where applicable, the rights for any musical works incorporated into your Content.

In addition to our dedication to protecting the rights of content creators and rights holders, it's important to acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Licensed Application or your possession and use of that Licensed Application infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, VisionLog, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim. This ensures that any issues of this nature are directed to and handled by VisionLog.

In line with our respect for intellectual property rights and to ensure compliance with copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), we follow a process to promptly address and remove any infringing material from our Services upon awareness. While we are dedicated to this process, it's important for users to understand their role in upholding the integrity of our platform by not engaging in copyright infringement or any activity that infringes on the rights of others.

If you believe that any Content on the Services infringes upon a copyright you own or control, you are encouraged to notify us at [hello@uvimby.com](mailto:hello@uvimby.com). Your report should include:

- the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
- identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;
- identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, with enough detail for us to locate it on our Services;
- your contact information, such as address, telephone number, and email address;
- a statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
- a statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your report is accurate, and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

Your vigilance helps us maintain a platform that respects the rights of all creators and users. We're committed to reviewing reported infringements and taking appropriate action, which may include removing Content or suspending user accounts in cases of repeated infringement.

## Safety

VisionLog is committed to fostering a safe environment for all users, but we can't guarantee this. Your actions and vigilance are key to maintaining a safe community for everyone. By engaging with our Services, you agree to always adhere to these Terms and any additional policies or guidelines we may establish to uphold the safety and integrity of the Services.

If you fail to comply, we reserve the right to take necessary actions to maintain our platform's safety. This could include removing any Content that violates our policies, suspending or terminating your account, limiting the visibility of your account, and retaining account-related data in line with our data retention policies. We may also need to inform and cooperate with law enforcement and other third parties, providing them with relevant account information, to protect our users, enforce our Terms, and address security or fraud concerns.

We also care about your physical safety while using our Services. Please don't use our Services in any way that would distract you from complying with traffic or safety laws, or in any other way that could endanger you or others. Our platform should never be a reason for compromising safety to take a spatial video or to engage with other VisionLog features. Always be mindful of your surroundings and prioritize safety over capturing Content.

## Your Account With Us

To access and use our Services, creating an account through Sign In with Apple is required. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Apple ID and for all activities that occur under your account. If you suspect any unauthorized access to your account or if your Apple ID is compromised, please address this issue directly with Apple as soon as possible. VisionLog relies on the security measures provided by Sign In with Apple and cannot access or manage your Apple ID credentials. If your account has previously been removed or banned from our Services, creating a new account is prohibited unless we have given explicit consent for you to do so.

When creating an account with VisionLog, you agree to associate your user account with a unique Apple ID used for subscription purposes. The use of multiple VisionLog accounts with a single Apple ID subscription is prohibited.

As part of our commitment to offering a seamless and up-to-date experience, any software provided by us as part of the Services may automatically download and install updates, upgrades, or new features. Depending on your device's settings, you might have the option to customize or disable these automatic downloads.

## Subscription Terms

To access and use VisionLog, all users are required to maintain an active auto-renewable subscription, managed through Apple's App Store. Each subscription must be linked to a unique Apple ID. Using a single subscription across multiple VisionLog accounts is against our Terms of Service and may lead to suspension of the implicated account(s). By creating an account with VisionLog, you acknowledge and agree to adhere to these subscription guidelines.

Upon creating an account with VisionLog, you must subscribe to use the app. This subscription will automatically renew unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for the renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscription directly through your App Store Account Settings after purchase. For more detailed instructions, please visit [Apple's support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039).

For any inquiries related to subscription billing, cancellation, or refund requests, please direct these to Apple. As the provider of the App Store, Apple handles all such transactions and support related to your subscription. We encourage you to review Apple's policies and utilize their support resources for any issues related to your subscription. This ensures that your requests are handled efficiently and in accordance with Apple's procedures.

## Data Charges and Network Use

Using our Services requires internet access for uploading and downloading Content, which may incur data usage charges from your mobile network provider or internet service provider. You are responsible for any charges that you may incur from your mobile or internet service provider when using our Services. If you're uncertain about potential data charges or have questions regarding your data plan, we strongly advise consulting with your mobile or internet service provider prior to using the Services. Your ability to manage data settings and preferences might also be facilitated by features on your device. Adjusting these settings can help control your data consumption while using our Services.

## Changes to the Services and These Terms

At VisionLog, we are dedicated to continuously enhancing our Services to offer the best possible experience. This commitment means we may introduce new features or functionalities, modify existing ones, or even suspend or discontinue the Services entirely. Such changes can happen at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to, maintaining service relevance, security enhancements, or legal and regulatory compliance. We reserve the right to implement these changes without prior notice to you to ensure the ongoing integrity and usability of our Services.

This also means we may need to update these Terms to reflect changes in our service offerings, adjustments required to comply with legal obligations, or other significant reasons related to legal or security considerations. When we make material changes to these Terms, we may let you know by revising the date at the top of these Terms that's available within the app. We may also provide you with additional notice (such as providing you with an in-app notification). We may provide you with advance notice whenever possible as required by law, except in urgent situations such as those also required by law or the introduction of new services or features.

By continuing to use our Services after these changes take effect, you acknowledge and agree to the updated Terms. We value your trust and encourage you to review the Terms periodically to ensure you remain informed about your rights and obligations as a user of our Services.

VisionLog is solely responsible for providing any maintenance and support services for the Licensed Application, as specified in these Terms or as required under applicable law. You and VisionLog acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Licensed Application.

## Termination and Suspension

We value every user of VisionLog and hope you enjoy using our Services for a long time. However, should you wish to terminate your agreement with us, you may do so at any time by contacting us via email at [hello@uvimby.com](mailto:hello@uvimby.com) to request the deletion of your account.

We reserve the right to restrict, terminate, or suspend your access to the Services if you fail to comply with these Terms, additional guidelines we provide, or the law, due to circumstances that are outside our control, or for any other reason deemed necessary to protect the integrity and safety of our platform and its users. This means we may stop providing you with all or part of the Services, or impose new or additional limits on your use of the Services. For example, accounts with prolonged inactivity may be deactivated, and usernames may be reclaimed at our discretion. While we aim to provide reasonable notice prior to such actions, it may not always be possible.

In cases where access is restricted due to a violation of additional guidelines we have provided you, we will notify you and offer an opportunity to appeal the decision. Before taking any action to restrict, terminate, or suspend an account, we will consider all relevant information and circumstances. This includes evaluating the severity, frequency, and impact of any violations, as well as the intent behind them, to determine the most appropriate course of action.

Excluding sections Who Can Use the Services and Privacy Policy of these Terms, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect even after termination or suspension of your account (to the extent any additional terms and conditions would, by their terms, survive), to ensure that both parties continue to respect the obligations agreed upon.

## Indemnity

You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless VisionLog, our affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees, licensors, and agents from any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that may arise due to, or relate in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services, or any products or services provided by a third party in connection with the Services, even if recommended, made available, or approved by VisionLog, (b) any Content you make available on our Services, including infringement claims related to your Content, (c) your violation of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation, or (d) your negligence or willful misconduct in connection with the use of our Services.

## Disclaimers

We aim to keep the Services continuously accessible and free from inconveniences. However, we cannot guarantee uninterrupted or flawless service. By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree to the following disclaimers:

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, WHILE WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE A SMOOTH USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, FREE FROM ERRORS, OR AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES, (B) THE SERVICES WILL OPERATE WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS, OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, OR UP-TO-DATE. 

You expressly acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, your use of the Licensed Application is at your sole risk and discretion. In the event of any failure of the Licensed Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Licensed Application to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Licensed Application, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be our sole responsibility.

NEITHER WE NOR OUR AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONTENT CREATED, UPLOADED, POSTED, SENT, RECEIVED, OR STORED ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES BY USERS OR THIRD PARTIES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MAY BE DEEMED OFFENSIVE, UNLAWFUL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE OBJECTIONABLE, AND WE ACCEPT NO LIABILITY FOR SUCH CONTENT.

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, VisionLog, INCLUDING OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AGENTS, AND SUPPLIERS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON THE SERVICES; (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that VisionLog, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have relating to the Licensed Application or your possession and/or use of the Licensed Application. This includes, but is not limited to, (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Licensed Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirements; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or privacy legislation. The limitations of liability set forth herein do not intend to limit VisionLog's liability beyond what is permitted by applicable law, nor do they exempt VisionLog from any responsibilities Apple disclaims under its policies.

## Arbitration, Applicable Law, and Jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any question regarding their existence, validity, or termination, shall be resolved through arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Canadian Arbitration Association ("CAA"), which are incorporated by reference into this clause. The arbitration proceedings shall take place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and the panel shall consist of one (1) arbitrator unless otherwise agreed. The arbitration shall be conducted in English.

By agreeing to these Terms, you waive any rights to participate in class actions or class-wide arbitration and agree that any arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis.

**Note:** The above arbitration agreement might not apply to you if your country's laws provide otherwise. We encourage you to review your local laws, as they may grant you additional rights or impose restrictions on our arbitration agreement.

## Severability

Should any provision of these Terms be deemed unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be removed from these Terms without affecting the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The rest of the Terms shall continue in full force and effect, ensuring that our agreement with you remains operational and binding.

## Final Terms

These Terms, along with any additional policies and guidelines referenced within, form the complete and exclusive agreement between you and VisionLog regarding your use of our Services. Nothing in these Terms is intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any third party.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and VisionLog acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, specifically in relation to your use of the Licensed Application. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof, in relation to your use of the Licensed Application.

VisionLog reserves the right to assign or transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, or acquisition, to another entity that commits to be bound by the provisions of these Terms.

You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without obtaining our explicit prior written consent. VisionLog reserves all rights not explicitly granted under these Terms.
