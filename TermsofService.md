        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <p>Last Updated: March 1, 2024</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to VisionLog. These Terms of Service, together
            with our Privacy Policy, ("Terms") govern our relationship with you
            as a user of VisionLog ("Services"). Our aim is to make
            our Services as user-friendly as possible, providing you with clear
            information on how they operate through these Terms and direct
            communications within the Services themselves, such as
            notifications, consents, and customizable settings. Collectively,
            this information forms the foundation of our agreement with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            While we've made an effort to ensure these Terms are
            straightforward, some sections may still resemble a traditional
            contract. This is necessary because our relationship with you needs
            to be supported by a legally binding agreement between you and VisionLog ("we" or "us"). We encourage you to read these Terms
            and the Privacy Policy carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree to these Terms,
            under which we grant you a non-transferable, non-exclusive,
            revocable, and non-sublicensable license to use the Services
            according to these Terms and our policies. If you do not agree with
            these Terms, please do not use the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE:</strong> These Terms include an
            arbitration clause. You and VisionLog agree that disputes
            between us will be resolved through mandatory binding arbitration,
            and both you and VisionLog waive any right to participate
            in a class-action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.
        </p>

        <h2>Who Can Use the Services</h2>
        <p>
            Our Services are intended for individuals who are 13 years of age or
            older. If you are under 13, or the minimum age required in your
            jurisdiction to use our Services without parental consent (whichever
            is greater, ("Minimum Age")), please do not engage with our
            Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            By creating an account with VisionLog, you acknowledge and
            agree that you have read, understood, and accept to be bound by
            these Terms. This acceptance is considered as your agreement to all
            the terms, conditions, policies, and notices stated here.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals
            under the Minimum Age. It is your responsibility to ensure that you
            meet the age requirements outlined in these Terms. Should we
            discover, or receive credible information, that you are under the
            Minimum Age, we will stop providing Services to you and delete your
            account and your data. This measure is in place to comply with legal
            standards and protect the privacy and safety of all our users.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a minor in your jurisdiction, typically under the age of
            18, we strongly encourage the involvement of a parent or guardian.
            Not only should a parent or guardian review these Terms with you to
            ensure understanding and agreement, but we also suggest they monitor
            your internet usage. This supervision helps ensure that your
            engagement with online content, including our Services, is
            appropriate and safe.
        </p>
        <p>By accessing our Services, you affirm that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You meet the Minimum Age requirement;</li>
            <li>
                You have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract
                with VisionLog;
            </li>
            <li>
                You have not been prohibited from using the Services under the
                laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction,
                such as being listed on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of
                Specially Designated Nationals or facing any similar
                restrictions;
            </li>
            <li>You are not a convicted sex offender;</li>
            <li>
                You agree to adhere to these Terms, along with all related
                policies referenced herein, in addition to complying with all
                applicable local, state, national, and international laws and
                regulations.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rights You Grant Us</h2>
        <p>
            Our Services provide you with the opportunity to upload content,
            including spatial videos ("Content"), which will be publicly
            accessible to all users. In doing so, you retain any ownership
            rights you may have in your Content. However, you grant VisionLog a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and
            transferable license to use, host, store, display, reproduce,
            modify, adapt, edit, publish, transmit, and distribute your Content.
            This license is necessary for us to operate, promote, and improve
            our Services, as well as to explore and develop new offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the public nature of the Content on our platform, it's
            important to understand that all Content you upload are
            automatically considered public and can be viewed by any user of the
            Services. By sharing Content, you grant VisionLog, our
            affiliates, and our users an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free,
            irrevocable, and perpetual license to access, use, reproduce,
            distribute, create derivative works from, and display your Content
            across any media for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.
            This extensive license includes not only the content itself, but
            also the use of any personal attributes like your username as part
            of that content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although not obligated, we reserve the right to access, review,
            screen, and delete any Content you provide at our discretion,
            especially if it's believed to violate these Terms or applicable
            laws. Ultimately, you are responsible for the Content you share
            through our Services. Remember, all Content must be suitable for
            individuals aged 13 and above.
        </p>
        <p>
            We welcome your suggestions and feedback regarding our Services.
            Please be aware that by providing feedback, you agree that VisionLog has the right to use and act upon such feedback
            without any obligations to provide acknowledgment or compensation to
            you, and that we will retain ownership of any developments that
            arise from your suggestions.
        </p>

            Content on VisionLog is created and shared by our users.
            The responsibility for the Content lies with the user or entity that
            submitted it. While we are committed to creating a safe and
            respectful platform, it's important to note that we cannot review
            all content shared on our Services. As such, we cannot, and do not,

        <p>Upon receiving a report, we will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Conduct a thorough and impartial review of the reported content or abusive user

            </li>
            <li>
                Reverse any prior decisions if an initial assessment was
                incorrect;
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the content and eject the user who provided the offending content is our assessment determines the content or user has violated the Terms.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We appreciate your cooperation and vigilance in reporting content
            that may not meet our standards. Together, we can continue to build

            Your vigilance helps us maintain a platform that respects the rights
            of all creators and users. We're committed to reviewing reported
            infringements and taking appropriate action, which may include

            infringement.

        <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p>
            VisionLog is committed to foster a safe environment for
            all users, but we can't guarantee this. Your actions and vigilance
            are key to maintaining a safe community for everyone. By engaging
            with our Services, you agree to always adhere to these Terms and any
            additional or policies guidelines we may establish to uphold the
            safety and integrity of the Services.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you fail to comply, we reserve the right to take necessary
            actions to maintain our platform's safety. This could include
            removing any Content that violates our policies, suspending or
            terminating your account, limiting the visibility of your account,
            and retaining account-related data in line with our data retention
            policies. We may also need to inform and cooperate with law
            enforcement and other third parties, providing them with relevant
            account information, to protect our users, enforce our Terms, and
            address security or fraud concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also care about your physical safety while using our Services.
            Please don't use our Services in any way that would distract you
            from complying with traffic or safety laws, or in any other way that
            could endanger you or others. Our platform should never be a reason
            for compromising safety to take a spatial video or to engage with
            other VisionLog features. Always be mindful of your
            surroundings and prioritize safety over capturing Content.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Account With Us</h2>
        <p>
            Registering for an account is required to use our Services. You are
            responsible for all activities that occur in your account, so make
            sure to keep it secure. We recommend choosing a strong password that
            is unique and not used for any other online account. If you suspect
            any unauthorized access to your account, please contact us
            immediately at <a href="mailto:hello@uvimby.com">hello@uvimby.com</a>. If your account has
            previously been removed or banned from our Services, creating a new
            account is prohibited unless we have given explicit consent for you
            to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
            When creating an account with VisionLog, you agree to
            associate your user account with a unique Apple ID used for
            subscription purposes. The use of multiple VisionLog accounts
            with a single Apple ID subscription is prohibited.
        </p>

        <p>
            As part of our commitment to offering a seamless and up-to-date
            experience, any software provided by us as part of the Services may
            automatically download and install updates, upgrades, or new
            features. Depending on your device's settings, you might have the
            option to customize or disable these automatic downloads.
        </p>
        <h2>Subscription Terms</h2>
        <p>
            To access and use VisionLog, all users are required to
            maintain an active auto-renewable subscription, which is processed
            through Apple's App Store. Each VisionLog account must be
            associated with a unique Apple ID. Subscribing with a single Apple
            ID and attempting to access VisionLog across multiple accounts
            violates these Terms and may result in the suspension of your
            account(s). By downloading and using VisionLog, you
            acknowledge and agree to these subscription requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            Upon downloading VisionLog, you must subscribe to use the app.
            This subscription will automatically renew unless it is canceled at
            least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account
            will be charged for the renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of
            the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscription by
            going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase. For
            more detailed instructions, please visit Apple's support page. For
            issues related to the subscription, including billing, cancellation,
            or refund requests, please contact Apple to manage subscriptions on
            your behalf.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Charges and Network Use</h2>
        <p>
            Using our Services requires internet access for uploading and
            downloading Content, which may incur data usage charges from your
            mobile network provider or internet service provider. You are
            responsible for any charges that you may incur from your mobile or
            internet service provider when using our Services. If you're
            uncertain about potential data charges or have questions regarding
            your data plan, we strongly advise consulting with your mobile or
            internet service provider prior to using the Services. Your ability
            to manage data settings and preferences might also be facilitated by
            features on your device. Adjusting these settings can help control
            your data consumption while using our Services.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to the Services and These Terms</h2>
        <p>
            At VisionLog, we are dedicated to continuously enhancing
            our Services to offer the best possible experience. This commitment
            means we may introduce new features or functionalities, modify
            existing ones, or even suspend or discontinue the Services entirely.
            Such changes can happen at any time and for any reason, including
            but not limited to, maintaining service relevance, security
            enhancements, or legal and regulatory compliance. We reserve the
            right to implement these changes without prior notice to you to
            ensure the ongoing integrity and usability of our Services.
        </p>

        <p>
            This also means we may need to update these Terms to reflect changes
            in our service offerings, adjustments required to comply with legal
            obligations, or other significant reasons related to legal or
            security considerations. When we make material changes to these
            Terms, we may let you know by revising the date at the top of these
            Terms that's available within the app. We may also provide you with
            additional notice (such as providing you with an in-app
            notification). We may provide you with advance notice whenever
            possible as required by law, except in urgent situations such as
            those also required by law or the introduction of new services or
            features.
        </p>

        <p>
            By continuing to use our Services after these changes take effect,
            you acknowledge and agree to the updated Terms. We value your trust
            and encourage you to review the Terms periodically to ensure you
            remain informed about your rights and obligations as a user of our
            Services.
        </p>

        <h2>Termination and Suspension</h2>
        <p>
            We value every user of VisionLog and hope you enjoy using
            our Services for a long time. However, should you wish to terminate
            your agreement with us, you may do so at any time by contacting us
            via email at <a href="mailto:hello@uvimby.com">hello@uvimby.com</a> to request the deletion of your
            account.
        </p>

        <p>
            We reserve the right to restrict, terminate, or suspend your access
            to the Services if you fail to comply with these Terms, additional
            guidelines we provide, or the law, due to circumstances that are
            outside our control, or for any other reason deemed necessary to
            protect the integrity and safety of our platform and its users. This
            means we may stop providing you with all or part of the Services, or
            impose new or additional limits on your use of the Services. For
            example, accounts with prolonged inactivity may be deactivated, and
            usernames may be reclaimed at our discretion. While we aim to
            provide reasonable notice prior to such actions, it may not always
            be possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            In cases where access is restricted due to a violation of additional
            guidelines we have provided you, we will notify you and offer an
            opportunity to appeal the decision. Before taking any action to
            restrict, terminate, or suspend an account, we will consider all
            relevant information and circumstances. This includes evaluating the
            severity, frequency, and impact of any violations, as well as the
            intent behind them, to determine the most appropriate course of
            action.
        </p>

        <p>
            Excluding sections Who Can Use the Services and Privacy Policy of
            these Terms, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in
            effect even after termination or suspension of your account (to the
            extent any additional terms and conditions would, by their terms,
            survive), to ensure that both parties continue to respect the
            obligations agreed upon.
        </p>

        <h2>Indemnity</h2>
        <p>
            You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and
            hold harmless VisionLog, our affiliates, directors,
            officers, shareholders, employees, licensors, and agents from any

        <h2>Arbitration, Applicable Law, and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada. Any
            disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including
            any question regarding their existence, validity, or termination,
            shall be resolved through arbitration. The arbitration shall be
            conducted in accordance with the rules of the Canadian Arbitration
            Association ("CAA"), which are incorporated by reference into this

        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> The above arbitration agreement might not
            apply to you if your country's laws provide otherwise. We encourage

        </p>

        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>
            Should any provision of these Terms be deemed unenforceable or
            invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision
            will be removed from these Terms without affecting the validity and
            enforceability of the remaining provisions. The rest of the Terms
            shall continue in full force and effect, ensuring that our agreement
            with you remains operational and binding.
